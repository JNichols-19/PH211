    "This is probably the most difficult measurement to understand, but the easiest to compute with very good accuracy. If you simply drop a mass into the water and let it sit at the bottom of the beaker, the weight you will measure will simply be the weight of the water plus the weight of the mass. However, if the mass is *suspended* in the water, the tension in the string will take up some of that weight. How much?\n",

    "Imagine that a block of Styrofoam were in the water. It would float. Why? Because it is *less* dense than water. Now imagine a block of gold in the water. It would sink. Why? Because it is *more* dense than water. So if we had something with *exactly* the same density as the water, it would neither float nor sink: it would remain stationary at any depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the tension in the string to support the cylinder, we are compensating for the higher density and forcing the cylinder to remain stationary---so it acts as if it were the same density as the water. When we measure the weight of the water plus the *suspended* mass, we should get the weight of the water *plus the weight of water which has the same volume as the cylinder*. Therefore, we find the volume of the cylinder by, first, finding the difference in mass with and without the cylinder:  \n",
