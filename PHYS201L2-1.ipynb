    "# Experiment 2: Airtrack I---Kinematics\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- To learn good lab practice\n",
    "- To learn how to estimate and propagate uncertainties\n",
    "- To learn how position, velocity, and acceleration are related\n",
    "- To learn how to use the Airtrack\n",
    "- To learn how to use PASCO Capstone Data Acquisition and Analysis software\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipment\n",
    "- One Airtrack, Blower, Cart, and Acoustic Sensor\n",
    "- One wooden reflector\n",
    "- One 2x4 “shim”\n",
    "- One 30 cm plastic ruler\n",
    "- One two-meter stick\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "- **Do not attempt to push the carts faster than 1 m/s.**\n",
    "- **Be careful placing the carts on the track.**\n",
    "- **Do not damage the track.** Please place paper underneath the carts when they are resting on the track without the air turned on.\n",
    "- **Do not slide the carts on the track without the air turned on.**"
